NAME
    muttdelay - A bash script to delay mails written via mutt

WTF?
    This is for scheduling the sending of mails for a specific future time.
    Unlinke postponing a mail which does not involve the scheduling.

  How it works
   Configuring Vim
    Do the following:

        cp /usr/share/muttdelay/muttdelay.vim ~/.vim/plugin/
        echo 'map ,L :call MuttDelay()<CR>' >> ~/.vimrc

   Configuring Cron
    And create an hourly cronjob such as:

        0 * * * * /usr/bin/muttdelay cron

   Configuring Mutt
    Configure mutt your way and ensure that you can send mails like this:

        mutt -s subject example@example.com mail.txt

    If it works, you can go on.

   Use it
    Open mutt, compose an email. Use Vim as your editor. After finishing
    writing your mail don't close Vim, but run

        ,L

    and the mail gets scheduled for sending for a later time. You can now
    leave vim without sending the mail via mutt directly.

    The mail itself is saved to

        ~/.muttdelay/SENDTIMESTAMP.COMPOSETIMESTAMP

    The cron job checks if there is any SENDTIMESTAMP lower than the current
    unix time stamp. And if so, all matching mails are sent.
